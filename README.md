# ds01-issues

Issue tracker for the Hertie Data Science Lab server (ds01).

## What this is for

Use this repo to report:

- **Bugs** — something is broken, erroring, or not working as expected
- **Access requests** — you need software installed, access to a group, or similar
- **Questions** — you're stuck and need guidance on how to do something on the server

## What this is NOT for

This is **not** for general technical support or office hours. If you need hands-on help, troubleshooting a complex issue, or want to discuss something in depth, please email me directly:

📧 **h.baker@hertie-school.org**

## How to file a good issue

1. **Click "New Issue"** and choose the appropriate template
2. **Fill in all required fields** — especially your Hertie email so I can follow up
3. **Paste terminal output, don't screenshot** — use code blocks like this:

   ````
   ```
   paste your error message or terminal output here
   ```
   ````

   This makes it much easier to read, search, and debug.

4. **Be specific** — include what you were trying to do, what command you ran, and what happened

## Response times
